Primarch Growth Vat Building

Sangprimus Portus Building

Primarch Specific Icons (Not sure what excatly to do here) (Maybe flip the helix of the Chapter ones and add some bedazzle? Or just make something that would remind you of them, like red skin and psyker thing i made for Magnus, and the wings for Sanguinius) (The helix should stay i feel)

Chapter and Primarch material icons?
    
## Code and XML
General Bugfixing here and there

# NEW ADDITIONS TO MAKE AT SOME POINT

Make frostblade xml

Make Fenrisian Wolves (Art also, maybe just take vanilla wolf and change it? Maybe ask someone who made a wolf like create for it and then change some of it)
These can then be found by a quest or by an event where they wander by. https://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Fenrisian_Wolf 
Should spawn one alpha and a couple of other ones, if alpha is slain, other ones immediately become tamed under the killer

Make Blood Chalice art and xml, an exotic item that when ingested by pawns with the red thirst, will completely fill essentially all need and restore all wounds. - https://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Blood_Chalice
