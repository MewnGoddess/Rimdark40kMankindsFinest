# TODO

## Balancing and final touches
Fill nightlord chapter gene with additional gene that might resist its effect

Balance primarch specific genes

Try and balance the more powerful genes. Still having them powerful, but not downright invicible, especially regardig taking damage.

Check cost list for various things - if they're balance and/or hard enough to aquire

Check market price for items as well.

## Text
Check descriptions
Compile list of features

use stuff like {PAWN_nameDef} and {PAWN_pronoun} in description texts instead of "Your" "Pawn" or other ways pawns are reffered too. (Where applicable)

Make sure all type of tags, defs and whatnot are prefixed with BEWH_

## Art

Icon for:

Chaplain: Strenghten Faith ability (is in the mods/idelogy folder)



(Maybe) new motes for the linking and circle of the living saint aura?

(Maybe) Some different backgrounds (the blue hexagon for xenotype or white circle thingy for endogenes) for the different genes? (Maybe keep the recoloured one psyker and pariah and then make some new type for the different super human, with increasing golden stuff and purity seals n stuff) (im just cooking here, this is not important)

## Code and XML

## Bugs


## Other

Should the Primarch specific genes be renamed? (currently the name is of the Primarch)


## Notes
To make a fully fledges chapter one should:
1) Make a geneDef for the chapter
2) Make a thingDef for the chapter 
3) Make a recipeDef for the chapter that inherits "BEWH_FirstbornVialInsertion" and "BEWH_PrimarisVialInsertion" and uses "DefModExtension_GeneseedVialRecipe" to define the item used and gene given.
4) Make a shoulderIconDef for your chapter to have a custom icon for the shoulder plates available (Optional)
4) Makes a chapterColourDef featuring the chapters colours, gene and icon. (Optional)


# NEW ADDITIONS TO MAKE AT SOME POINT (Not for first release most likely)

Make frostblade xml?

Make Fenrisian Wolves (Art also)
These can then be found by a quest or by an event where they wander by. 
Should spawn one alpha and a couple of other ones, if alpha is slain, other ones immediately become tamed under the killer. Should also be made compatible with whatever mount riding framework is currently da shit(best), giddy up 2?
https://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Fenrisian_Wolf 

Make Blood Chalice art and xml, an exotic item that when ingested by pawns with the red thirst, will completely fill essentially all need and restore all wounds. Would be found in a quest to give one. One use, can be replenished somehow - https://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Blood_Chalice 

SOS2 integration?

Living Saint armor?

accessories for shoulder pad or armor in general. Just patch in render nodes or put them directly and add new tab for em.


# Grey Knight

Add Grey Knight genetic material? possibly also a rankCategory for them along with their ranks?? https://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Grey_Knights
