## Art
Primarch Growth Vat Building

Primarch Specific Icons (Not sure what excatly to do here) (Maybe flip the helix of the Chapter ones and add some bedazzle? Or just make something that would remind you of them, like red skin and psyker thing i made for Magnus, and the wings for Sanguinius) (The helix should stay i feel) (I think i learn towards just flipping the helix and adding some bedazzle)

Chapter and Primarch material thing icons?

Ability Icons for primarch abilities (Forestwalk long and short, Alakh Geh, Deny the Witch, Veil of Darkness, Angron Beserk, Conceal)

Maybe some different backgrounds for the different genes? (Maybe keep the recoloured one psyker and pariah and then make some new type for the different super human, with increasing golden stuff and purity seals n stuff) (im just cooking here, this is not important)

# NEW ADDITIONS TO MAKE AT SOME POINT

Make frostblade xml?

Make Fenrisian Wolves (Art also, maybe just take vanilla wolf and change it? Maybe ask someone who made a wolf like create for it and then change some of it)
These can then be found by a quest or by an event where they wander by. 
Should spawn one alpha and a couple of other ones, if alpha is slain, other ones immediately become tamed under the killer. Should also be made compatible with whatever mount riding framework is currently da shit(best), giddy up 2?
