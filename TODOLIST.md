Primarch Growth Vat Building

Sangprimus Portus Building

Primarch Specific Icons (Not sure what excatly to do here) (Maybe flip the helix of the Chapter ones and add some bedazzle? Or just make something that would remind you of them, like red skin and psyker thing i made for Magnus, and the wings for Sanguinius) (The helix should stay i feel) (I think i learn towards just flipping the helix and adding some bedazzle)

Chapter and Primarch material icons?
    
## Code and XML
General Bugfixing here and there

## Other
Should the Primarch specific genes be renamed? (currently the name is of the Primarch)

# NEW ADDITIONS TO MAKE AT SOME POINT

Make frostblade xml?

Make Fenrisian Wolves (Art also, maybe just take vanilla wolf and change it? Maybe ask someone who made a wolf like create for it and then change some of it)
These can then be found by a quest or by an event where they wander by. 
Should spawn one alpha and a couple of other ones, if alpha is slain, other ones immediately become tamed under the killer. Should also be made compatible with whatever mount riding framework is currently da shit(best), giddy up 2?
