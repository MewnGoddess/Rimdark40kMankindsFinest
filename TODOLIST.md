## Art

Primarch Specific Icons (Not sure what excatly to do here) (Maybe flip the helix of the Chapter ones and add some bedazzle? Or just make something that would remind you of them, like red skin and psyker thing i made for Magnus, and the wings for Sanguinius) (The helix should stay i feel) (I think i learn towards just flipping the helix and adding some bedazzle)

Chapter and Primarch material thing icons?

Ability Icons for primarch abilities (Forestwalk long and short, Alakh Geh, Deny the Witch, Veil of Darkness, Angron Beserk, Conceal)

Maybe some different backgrounds (the blue hexagon for xenotype or white circle thingy for endogenes) for the different genes? (Maybe keep the recoloured one psyker and pariah and then make some new type for the different super human, with increasing golden stuff and purity seals n stuff) (im just cooking here, this is not important)
    
Insert and Eject primarch Embryo icon

And icon for starting for primarch vat

## Code and XML

Make sangprimus spit out materials when destryoed

For sangprimus material tab, make unacquired materials have a strike through them by using the rect used to print the text and setting its ylevel at half the height of it

Make StockGenerator for chapter materials that check if they have already been bought

## Bugs


## Other
Should the Primarch specific genes be renamed? (currently the name is of the Primarch)

# NEW ADDITIONS TO MAKE AT SOME POINT

Make rank/specialization upgrade system
^^Make rank system in framework instead, also make def for ranks there, and a def for different categories that can be toggled between
Category def from above should have heddifdef and genedef field required, which will be used to tell whether it can be shown

Make frostblade xml?

Make Fenrisian Wolves (Art also, maybe just take vanilla wolf and change it? Maybe ask someone who made a wolf like create for it and then change some of it)
These can then be found by a quest or by an event where they wander by. 
Should spawn one alpha and a couple of other ones, if alpha is slain, other ones immediately become tamed under the killer. Should also be made compatible with whatever mount riding framework is currently da shit(best), giddy up 2?
