# Proto-Ossmodula

Proto-Ossmodula is the early prototype of an organ, that is capable of rapidly increasing one's bone mass, as well as the density of bone tissue itself. Implanted adjacent to hypophysis, Proto-Ossmodula injects growth hormones into recipient's body, thus making them significantly bulkier and more resistant to damage. 
Note, that each of the prototype genetic implants bears a risk of genetic instability and significantly reduces the recipient's life span, as well as creates additional risks.

Complexity: +3

Suppressed traits: 
- Delicate 
- Wimp

Effects: 
- Leather & Meat amount X150% 
- Incoming damage multiplier: x90% 
- Cosmetic body size multiplier: x125% 
- Armor: Blunt +15%
- Sharp +15%
- Heat +5%
- Suppression power +30% 
- Lifespan factor x80%
- Cancer rate factor x110%
- Mental break threshold +7% (due to hormones being changed "on the fly" and the body not having enough time to adapt to it + the instability thing)



# Musculeator

A liver-like membraneous organ, placed behind the recipient's heart, is designed to provide the recipient's muscular structure with a significant growth boost. The improved muscles exceed the normal ones in terms of regeneration speed, their overal strength and density. 
Musculeator is installed at the same time as the Proto-Ossmodula
Note, that each of the prototype genetic implants bears a risk of genetic instability and significantly reduces the recipient's life span, as well as creates additional risks.

- Manipulation x120%
- Lifespan factor x80%
- Cancer rate factor x110%
- Social fight chance factor x150%



# Mentanifex

A T-shaped organ, implanted right next to the brain stem. It stimulates the growth of nerve tissues, improving the recipient's reaction and situational awareness, but due to the very specific chemical compounds released into the bloodstream, as a bi-product of this organ, it also notably increases one's aggression. Yet, this implant proves it's necessity, simply due to the fact that increased reaction is required to fully utilize the Thunder Warrior's enchanced biology.
Note, that each of the prototype genetic implants bears a risk of genetic instability and significantly reduces the recipient's life span, as well as creates additional risks.
