# NEW ADDITIONS TO MAKE AT SOME POINT

Patch eltex to recipies if VPE is present, do it from inside the royalty folder

Make Fenrisian Wolves (Art also, maybe just take vanilla wolf and change it? Maybe ask someone who made a wolf like create for it and then change some of it)
These can then be found by a quest or by an event where they wander by. https://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Fenrisian_Wolf 
Should spawn one alpha and a couple of other ones, if alpha is slain, other ones immediately become tamed under the killer


Make Blood Chalice art and xml, an exotic item that when ingested by pawns with the red thirst, will completely fill essentially all need and restore all wounds. - https://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Blood_Chalice
