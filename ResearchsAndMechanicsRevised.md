    - Working on this item will add a hediff that will slowly decrease the pawns conciousness (possibly something else), potentially knocking them out (Psychic focus was not chosen as that would    place an additional requirement of royalty, which i would like to avoid)
    - After the creation, the custodes genetic matrix would need to be gestated in order to become implantable (like a xenogerm implant thingy) and the resulting custodes would have a randomized set of bonuses, ranging from 1% to 20% for things like resistances, melee speed, social impact, etc, as the custodes are unique and for the most part have been "crafted" by Big E himself.

Xenotype:
 - Custodes

# ++++ Notes ++++

All the creation step creates a Geneseed vial, that must be kept properly and must be gestated.


Primarch genetic material will be an item, that can be brought from traders, possibly as a reward from quests. These will contain extra information that will give the primarch their uniqueness


For the creation of any of these to following apply:
 - You unlock the research to unlock the creation of the matrix of said "Germline". You then create the germline at the require bench. This is then gestated for the required amount before giving out an item akin to the xenogerm that can then be applied on a pawn.
 For Thunder Warriors, Custodes and Primarch they are applied and thats the end of that.
 For Space Marines or Primaris marines, multiple xenogerms are created (4 for SM and 5 for PM), The first is implanted after which the next can be implanted after X days untill all are implanted.


The implantation of these will all have different ages where it is he most succesful:
For instance for custodes and primarchs a child between 0-2 years will be the prime target, where the older the pawn is from the area here will be a higher and higher chance for the pawn to simply die with the Geneseed vial going to waste.
For Thunder warriors, SM and PM probably between the age of 14-18 and follows same rule as above


Additionally there will be research to enable to player to extract Space marine and Primaris marine geneseeds. These will spawn geneseed vials that are gestated.


# ++++ Final Notes ++++

This is a little different from what you sent, as i wanted to try and streamline it, to make it all more similar in process.
