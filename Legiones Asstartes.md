## Own ideas

Specific Chapter Genes;
Iron Hand(WIP); Give transhumanist trait, and increase global work speed when one or more prosthetics is present? 
Raven Guard(WIP); Increased hunting stealth and shooting stuff

Specific Primarch Genes;
Corvus(WIP); Ability to go invis, hunting stealth increase
Ferrus Manus(WIP); Crafting and quality boost, and also slightly for building
Vulkan(WIP); Thought of making 2 perpetual genes, one lesser and one "normal". Vulkan gets the lesser version, making carriers almost immortal
